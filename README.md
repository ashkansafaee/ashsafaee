# Hi, I'm Ashkan 👋

I'm a senior operator and 3x founder based in Stockholm, currently completing a B.Sc. in Mathematical Statistics and Machine Learning at Stockholm University — with 30 ECTS completed at Master's level concurrently.

For two decades I've built and run organisations: managing teams of 150+, overseeing portfolios of 2B SEK, and co-founding companies from zero to market across tech, consulting, and professional services. My work has consistently been about building operational structures that let teams move fast without losing control.

Going back to study wasn't a career change — it was a deliberate investment in rigour. I wanted to be able to think clearly about statistical inference, model uncertainty, and data-driven systems, not just manage the people who do. These projects are the output of that.
